<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a PhD candidate working on experiments related to quantum sensing using single Rubidium atoms in solid Neon matrices. Previously, I did some work on theoretical particle physics and cosmology and produced a Master’s thesis on “Generalized Higgs Inflation” which explores various models of Higgs Inflation to explain the problems in the standard Big Bang Cosmology. I also worked for some condensed matter theory exploring the disorder effects in bilayer graphene systems.</p> <p>Professionally, I served as Lecturer in Physics for over ten years and taught various Undergraduate level physics courses.</p> <p>Other than my work routine, I am very much engaged in science communication and writing blogs and organizing schools and seminars to popularize science and fundamental theories of Physics. I love to attend conferences and travel to different places and meet new people to learn from their experience and share my own with them. This helps me to socialize (breaking the stereotype of anti-social scientists lol) and get connected with people both in and out of my own domain of research.</p> </body></html>
