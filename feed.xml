When we train a deep-learning model to <strong>reconstruct electromagnetic (EM) showers</strong>, we want to know how well it has learned to assemble those pieces back into the right physical picture.</p> <p>To measure that, physicists use a family of <strong>clustering and learning metrics</strong> — mathematical scorecards that tell us how “physicist-like” the machine’s reconstruction really is. Let’s unpack some of these metrics in plain language.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="1-adjusted-rand-index-ari">1. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)</h2> <p>Imagine you and your friend both try to sort puzzle pieces into their correct pictures. The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) checks <strong>how similar your sorting is</strong>, while correcting for the chance that you might agree just by luck.</p> <p>If both of you consistently group the same pairs of pieces together, ARI will be close to <strong>1.0</strong> — perfect agreement. If your grouping is random, it hovers near <strong>0</strong>. Negative values mean you are actively disagreeing (rare, but interesting).</p> <p>Formally, scientists measure it as:</p> \[\text{ARI} = \frac{\text{RI} - E(\text{RI})}{\max(\text{RI}) - E(\text{RI})}\] <p>where the <strong>Rand Index (RI)</strong> measures how consistently pairs are grouped in both the true and predicted clusters:</p> \[\text{RI} = \frac{a + b}{a + b + c + d}\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>\(a\): pairs in the same group in both truth and prediction</li> <li>\(b\): pairs in different groups in both</li> <li>\(c\): pairs in the same group in truth but different in prediction</li> <li>\(d\): pairs in the same group in prediction but different in truth</li> </ul> <h3 id="example-step-by-step-ri-calculation">Example: Step-by-step RI calculation</h3> <p>Let us go through a small example to see where the numbers come from.

Purity — “How clean are the predicted groups?”</h2> <p>Purity examines each <strong>predicted cluster</strong> the model creates. It asks whether all fragments in that cluster truly belong to the same physical shower. A perfectly pure cluster means the model did not mix fragments from different particles. If fragments from two showers end up together, purity drops.</p> \[\text{Purity} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \max_j |c_i \cap t_j|\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(N\): total number of fragments</li> <li>\(c_i\): fragments in predicted cluster \(i\)</li> <li>\(t_j\): fragments in true cluster \(j\)</li> </ul> <p>Think of it like this: each cluster is a jar, and each particle’s fragments are colored marbles. Purity measures how many red marbles slipped into a jar meant for blue ones.</p> <p>High purity = clean clusters, minimal mixing.<br/> But purity alone does not punish <strong>over-splitting</strong> — if one true shower is divided into many small predictions, purity might still look good. That is why we also track <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="3-clustering-efficiency--how-complete-are-the-true-showers">3. Clustering Efficiency — “How complete are the true showers?”</h2> <p>Efficiency flips the question. Instead of asking “Is each prediction clean?”, it asks “Did we recover each true shower completely?”</p> \[\text{Efficiency} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \max_j |t_i \cap c_j|\] <p>A high efficiency means the AI grouped most of a true particle’s fragments together — a test of <strong>completeness</strong>, not cleanliness.</p> <p>A good reconstruction strikes a balance:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Purity</strong> rewards precision (no contamination).</li> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> rewards recall (no fragmentation).</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br/> Purity is like making sure no wrong puzzle pieces are in your pile.<br/> Efficiency is making sure you actually found <em>all</em> the right ones.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="4-edge-and-node-accuracy">4.

The <strong>edge accuracy</strong> is simply:</p> \[\text{Edge Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct edge predictions}}{\text{Total edges}}\] <p>Similarly, <strong>node accuracy</strong> checks whether each fragment is correctly labeled as a <em>primary</em> — the one that started the shower.</p> <blockquote> <p>In other words, edge accuracy tests relationships, while node accuracy tests identities.

Loss — “How far are predictions from the truth?”</h2> <p>While accuracy counts how many predictions were right, <strong>loss</strong> tells us <em>how confident</em> the model was when it was right or wrong.

(PDF)</a></p> <hr/> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>With the creation of the first star, the formation of large-scale structures began and ultimately evolved into the present universe. Regarding the structure formation, two scenarios have been proposed: <em>top-down</em> and <em>bottom-up</em>. In the top-down scenario, clusters form first and fragment into galaxies. However, this scenario is not much appreciated and theoretical and observational indications rule this out. In the bottom-up scenario, primordial seeds of the universe formed protogalaxies which formed galaxies and then merged into clusters and then superclusters. This formation is favored by observations. This structure formation is spanned over the course of billions of years and is still continued today. New stars are being born and old stars are dying.</p> <p>In all this situation, one thinks if the universe is composed of all the mighty cosmological objects then how much all this stuff weighs? How much does the universe weigh? Before weighing the universe, we must know where all the matter of the universe is located. This matter is divided into two categories — one which is known to us and emits light, and second is a little bit mysterious, somehow unknown to us, neither emits nor absorbs light of any wavelength.</p> <p>The most prominent and largest sources of visible matter are the stars, and the most easy and well-known way to look at stars in larger regions. These mighty stellar objects emit photons of different wavelengths such as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet, in all directions. But they only contribute to <strong>0.3%</strong> of the total energy density of the universe. Even if we consider other stellar and sub-stellar objects such as neutron stars, black holes, black and brown dwarfs, this density parameter will still be much less than the observed one (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>).</p> <p>Despite the fact that it is not an easy and handy task to detect all of the baryonic constituent of the universe, it is still interesting that nearly <strong>85%</strong> of the baryonic matter of the universe is in the form of interstellar medium (ISM)<d-footnote>Interstellar medium is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. This matter includes gas in ionic, atomic, and molecular form, as well as dust and cosmic rays. (Source: Wikipedia)</d-footnote> and a slender gas in intergalactic space<d-footnote>Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. It's almost empty, but not quite, as there are gas particles and so on floating around.</d-footnote>. However, Big Bang nucleosynthesis constrains that critical density of the universe cannot be comprised of normal material only; otherwise, the present abundances of light elements will not agree with the observations. Even if we consider CMB radiations along with BBN, this baryonic matter density parameter will still be less than the total energy density of the universe (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>).</p> <p>The situation becomes worse when it is known to us that not only are we unable to detect a large percentage of baryonic matter, but the major constituent of the critical density of the universe is not even baryonic. In 1932, Jan Oort was observing the Sun and other stars in the Milky Way when he postulated the existence of this hidden constituent of the universe — <em>local dark matter</em> (<d-cite key="Bertone"></d-cite>). A strong evidence for Oort’s observations was put forward by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 during the study of redshifts of galaxies in the Coma cluster (Abell 1656) (<d-cite key="jaan"></d-cite>). He found that individual velocities of galaxies are much greater than the mean velocity of the cluster. In this scenario, the cluster cannot hold in the form it is because of strong gravitational pull. The only way to shield from expansion is the assumption of some invisible matter which can provide enough gravitational force. Zwicky called this invisible matter <em>dunkle Materie</em> — dark matter.</p> <p>Since dark matter does not emit, absorb, or scatter light, it is quite difficult to detect. It is theorized that it can interact only with conventional matter via gravitational force. Direct interaction is near impossible to detect with modern-day technologies. However, its gravitational influence on visible matter can be studied by inspecting orbital speeds of stars in spiral galaxies<d-footnote>In a spiral galaxy, the stars, gas, and dust are gathered in spiral arms that spread outward from the galaxy's center. (Source: &lt;https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/217-What-is-a-spiral-galaxy-&gt;)</d-footnote> — for example, the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31).</p> <p>At a length scale of a few kiloparsecs, the mass of a star inside that radius becomes essentially constant, and if stars contribute all (or most of) the mass of the galaxy, the orbital velocity will be proportional to the inverse square root of the radius. This is called <strong>Keplerian rotation</strong>. Using this, Kepler found that 99.8% of the mass of the solar system is contained within the Sun. In 1970, when Rubin and Ford calculated the orbital velocity of Andromeda at different radii, using the Keplerian relation, they didn’t find any decrease in the Keplerian velocity and found it to be nearly constant. This cannot be possible unless stars contribute to most or all of the galaxy mass (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>). It provided a strong evidence for the presence of the <em>dark halo</em> — dark matter.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="classification-of-dark-matter">Classification of Dark Matter</h2> <p>Usually, dark matter is classified in three categories: <em>hot, cold</em>, and <em>warm</em>. Although these terminologies have nothing to do with the degree of temperature, this classification is based on the distances traveled by the particles before they scatter — the <strong>free-streaming length (FSL)</strong>. This classification also guides us about the structure formation of dark matter — whether it follows bottom-up formation or top-down structure.</p> <p><em>Hot dark matter (HDM)</em> consists of particles having ultrarelativistic speeds, and their free-streaming length is larger than a protogalaxy<d-footnote>It is the large concentration of gas and dust from which a galaxy is formed. It is also called as “primeval galaxy.”</d-footnote>. HDM favors the top-down formation of the universe — the early universe first formed into larger groups of clusters and superclusters and then, with the passage of time, fragmented into smaller galaxies and other cosmological objects. But the data of CMBR acquired by COBE<d-footnote>Cosmic Background Explorer or Explorer 66.</d-footnote> discards the top-down formation and verifies the uniform and smooth formation of the universe. This formation is also unfavored by the observation of high redshift of galaxies. Moreover, the ultrarelativistic speeds of particles cannot allow these particles to clump together to form larger cosmological structures. Active neutrinos are thought to be one of its main candidates.</p> <p><em>Cold dark matter (CDM)</em> is composed of particles having smaller speeds than the speed of light, and their free-streaming length is much smaller than a protogalaxy. It favors bottom-up formation in the universe, which makes it capable of explaining the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This is responsible for the genesis of large-scale structures in the universe. CDM is thought to be the most perfect and successful interpretation of dark matter and structure formation of the universe. CDM also gives us an inkling of the presence of non-baryonic dark matter along with baryonic dark matter. There are a number of proposed candidates for CDM which span from sub-atomic particles to intergalactic objects. Its proposed candidates are <strong>axions, MACHOs, thermal WIMPs,</strong> and <strong>supersymmetric particles</strong>. Having a well-established theoretical framework, there are some proposed properties of CDM candidates:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mass:</strong> CDM candidates should be massive (&gt;1 keV) along with a longer life.</li> <li><strong>Collisionless:</strong> CDM particles should be collisionless; they should only interact via gravity.</li> <li><strong>Dissipationless:</strong> They should not cool by radiating photons as ordinary baryonic matter does to form galaxies. With collisionless and dissipationless nature, they can form halos despite galactic structures (<d-cite key="einasto"></d-cite>). However, this is tricky because a massive particle with no electric charge will surely have some kind of dissipation (<d-cite key="carroll"></d-cite>).</li> <li><strong>Lifetime:</strong> Their lifetime must be comparable to or larger than the age of the present-day universe.</li> </ul> <p><em>Warm dark matter (WDM)</em> lies in between hot and cold dark matter. Particles which constitute WDM have a free-streaming length comparable to a protogalaxy. Its predictions are quite similar to cold dark matter but with a clear difference of small-scale density perturbations — it predicts less abundance of dwarf galaxies, a consequence of low density of dark matter in the central bulge of larger galaxies. Its proposed candidates are <strong>sterile neutrinos, gravitinos,</strong> and <strong>non-thermal WIMPs</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="candidates-of-dark-matter">Candidates of Dark Matter</h2> <p>In cosmology and particle physics, there is no shortage of proposed candidates for dark matter. They range from the tiniest neutrinos to black holes, showing both the variety of proposed models and the lack of our understanding.</p> <p>Dark matter can be classified into two broad categories: <strong>baryonic</strong> and <strong>non-baryonic</strong>.<br/> Below we group the candidates according to the classification of dark matter.</p> <h3 id="baryonic-dark-matter">Baryonic Dark Matter</h3> <p>Big Bang nucleosynthesis puts a constraint that dark matter cannot be entirely baryonic; otherwise, the present density of light elements would be different (<d-cite key="roos_2008"></d-cite>). However, a smaller part of dark matter can be baryonic. Unlike other baryonic material, it is surely non-luminous and cannot be observed directly — but its gravitational effects on visible matter can be detected indirectly. Proposed baryonic candidates include <strong>dust, clouds</strong> of hot and cold gas, <strong>snowballs of frozen hydrogenic matter</strong>, and <strong>collapsed stars</strong> like brown dwarfs. Dust and clouds of gas were rejected while the others were grouped as <strong>MACHOs</strong> along with other similar objects (<d-cite key="badcosmo"></d-cite>).</p> <h3 id="non-baryonic-dark-matter">Non-Baryonic Dark Matter</h3> <p>A large part of dark matter consists of non-baryonic particles which do not radiate, absorb, or scatter light. Among dozens of different proposals, the most popular three candidates are <strong>neutrinos</strong>, <strong>axions</strong>, and <strong>weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)</strong>.</p> <h4 id="candidates-of-hot-dark-matter">Candidates of Hot Dark Matter</h4> <p><strong>Active neutrinos.</strong><br/> Standard Model neutrinos (active neutrinos) are the lightest known fermions. They are electrically neutral and interact only via gravity and weak nuclear force. Being relativistic and collisionless particles, they favor top-down formation. But their relic mass density indicates there are not enough active neutrinos to be the dominant dark matter. However, <strong>sterile neutrinos</strong> may contribute.</p> <h4 id="candidates-of-warm-dark-matter">Candidates of Warm Dark Matter</h4> <p><strong>Sterile neutrinos.</strong><br/> Proposed in 1993 by Scott Dodelson and Lawrence M. Widrow (<d-cite key="sterile1994"></d-cite>), sterile neutrinos are heavier than active ones. They have slower speeds, do not take part in oscillations, and interact only via gravity. Their mass can range from less than 1 eV to 10¹⁵ GeV. They were also proposed as a CDM candidate by Xiangdong Shi and George Fuller (<d-cite key="fuller1999"></d-cite>) if produced non-thermally with a small lepton asymmetry and masses between 100 eV and 10 keV.</p> <h4 id="candidates-of-cold-dark-matter">Candidates of Cold Dark Matter</h4> <p><strong>MACHOs.</strong><br/> Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects include white dwarfs, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and even black holes. Composed of non-luminous baryonic matter, they were detected in 1993 by <strong>gravitational microlensing</strong>, when MACHOs near a star bend its light, temporarily brightening it — a rare phenomenon observed across millions of stars.</p> <p><strong>Primordial black holes.</strong><br/> Formed before Big Bang nucleosynthesis, they are non-radiating and long-lived. Theoretical and observational mass limits range from 0.3–30 M☉, possibly up to 10⁵ M☉ (<d-cite key="roos_2008"></d-cite>).</p> <p><strong>Thermal WIMPs.</strong><br/> Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are massive, neutral, non-relativistic, and interact mainly via gravity. During the early universe, they were in thermal equilibrium with photons, but as the universe cooled, annihilations froze out, leaving a stable relic population — today’s dark matter (<d-cite key="freeman2006"></d-cite>).</p> <p><strong>Axions.</strong><br/> Hypothetical particles proposed in 1977 by Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in QCD.

This era is notable for the formation of atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. During this phase, deuterons formed as protons fused with neutrons, releasing photons in the process. These deuterons then reacted with other deuterons, protons, and neutrons to produce helium–3, helium–4, hydrogen, and lithium–7 nuclei (<d-cite key="alpher1948origin"></d-cite>). BBN also led to an important realization: protons and neutrons were nearly equal in number at the end of the hadron epoch, and there were no sufficiently energetic photons left to dissociate these particles. If all protons and neutrons had fused to form deuterium and helium, no hydrogen would remain. This led to the conjecture that there must be a vast abundance of photons — roughly <strong>one billion photons per baryon</strong> in the universe.</p> <p>This insight originated from the famous <em>Alpher–Bethe–Gamow ($\alpha\beta\gamma$) paper</em>, which provided the first theoretical prediction of the <strong>cosmic background radiation</strong> more than a decade before its accidental discovery by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965 (<d-cite key="penzias1965cmb"></d-cite>).

This was a <em>radiation–dominated era</em>, during which the universe existed as a hot, dense plasma composed mainly of atomic nuclei, electrons, and photons. However, because radiation energy density scales with the inverse fourth power of the universe’s size, radiation diluted rapidly as the universe expanded. As the temperature dropped, photons ceased to interact frequently with nuclei. They began to free-stream through space, making the universe transparent and giving rise to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) spectrum (<d-cite key="wright1992cobe"></d-cite>). This transition marks the beginning of large–scale structure (LSS) formation, but before exploring LSS, let us take a brief look at the CMBR itself.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2022-04-10-evolution-history-of-universe-10-seconds-to-10-billion-years/ch01_fig03_Coincidence-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2022-04-10-evolution-history-of-universe-10-seconds-to-10-billion-years/ch01_fig03_Coincidence-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2022-04-10-evolution-history-of-universe-10-seconds-to-10-billion-years/ch01_fig03_Coincidence-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2022-04-10-evolution-history-of-universe-10-seconds-to-10-billion-years/ch01_fig03_Coincidence.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Evolution of the contents of the universe with the scale factor (Credits: 2011 Pearson Education, Inc.)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Evolution of the contents of the universe with the scale factor (Credits: 2011 Pearson Education, Inc.). </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="cosmic-microwave-background-radiation-cmbr">Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)</h2> <p>The <strong>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)</strong> provides the most direct evidence from the early universe, allowing us to study its physical state shortly after the Big Bang. It confirms that the <strong>matter–radiation crossover</strong> occurred at a redshift of approximately 1,100, nearly 50,000 years after the Big Bang — the last moment when the universe was still opaque. This boundary between the opaque and transparent universe is called the <strong>surface of last scattering</strong>. At that time, the temperature of the CMBR was about $3,000~\text{K}$, and it followed an almost perfect blackbody spectrum. As the universe continued to expand, the photons were redshifted, reducing their energy and temperature uniformly. The present temperature of the CMBR is approximately $2.725~\text{K}$, which still matches an ideal blackbody distribution, though not perfectly — the small deviations correspond to minute temperature anisotropies in the early universe.</p> <p>From these tiny fluctuations, cosmologists can infer the inhomogeneities that seeded the large-scale structures we observe today. In the late 20th century, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite<d-cite key="wright1992cobe"></d-cite> measured the CMBR intensity across the infrared region over a wide range of wavelengths to detect any anisotropies. It determined the CMBR temperature to be $2.725 \pm 0.002~\text{K}$, confirming the isotropy of the universe on the largest scales and, consequently, its overall homogeneity<d-footnote>COBE’s results were later refined by the WMAP and Planck missions, which measured even smaller anisotropies in the CMB.</d-footnote>.</p> <h2 id="the-recombination-and-decoupling-era-t-sim-380000--textyears">The Recombination and Decoupling Era ($t \sim 380{,}000 \, \text{years}$)</h2> <p>When photons began to free-stream across the universe, forming the basis of today’s <em>relic radiation</em>, the universe experienced its <em>first moment of calm</em> after the Hot Big Bang. These non–interacting photons allowed electrons to combine with protons, forming neutral atoms — a process known as <strong>recombination</strong>. As recombination progressed, scattering among particles diminished and photons were finally able to propagate freely throughout space. This event marked the <strong>decoupling</strong> of matter and radiation, after which photons no longer scattered as they had before. This decoupling occurred on a spherical surface known as the <strong>surface of last scattering</strong> (or <strong>Last Scattering Surface, LSS</strong>), whose radius corresponds to the distance traveled by each photon since its last interaction during recombination.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-cosmic-dark-ages">The Cosmic Dark Ages</h2> <p>Shortly after recombination and decoupling, the universe entered a long and silent phase known as the <strong>Dark Ages</strong> — the period between recombination and the formation of the <strong>first stars</strong>. Although the name suggests a universe devoid of light, this was not entirely true. The CMBR still permeated space, and neutral hydrogen atoms emitted the characteristic $21\text{cm}$ spectral line<d-footnote>The $21\text{cm}$ radiation corresponds to the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and serves as a crucial probe for mapping matter distribution during the Dark Ages.</d-footnote>.

The discernment of this <em>infinite space</em> began when humankind first gazed at the bluish, vast, and mysterious dome above — the sky. This marks the origin of <strong>cosmology</strong> — a science devoted to studying the universe based on theoretical predictions, expressed through elegant mathematical equations, and observations coming from far–off regions of the cosmos. Cosmology, being distinct from other branches of science, is special in its essence; it seeks to understand the ultimate cause of creation and how things work at the most fundamental level. Let us take a brief look at how our cosmos evolved into its present state.</p> <p>The story of <strong>physical cosmology</strong> centers around the exploration of the <strong>Hot Big Bang Model</strong>, the widely accepted model explaining how the universe came into being and evolved. According to this model, the universe began with a <em>mighty bang</em> — an explosive expansion of an infinitely dense singularity containing all matter, energy, and spacetime. As time progressed, this singularity expanded and cooled. The term <em>Big Bang</em> was coined in 1949 by <strong>Fred Hoyle</strong><d-footnote>Fred Hoyle introduced the term “Big Bang” during a BBC radio broadcast, though he himself did not support the theory.</d-footnote>.

Einstein’s <em>General Relativity</em> becomes applicable from this scale onward, but there exists neither an implementable theory nor an observational probe to reveal what occurred <em>before</em> the Planck time. It is theorized that during this epoch, all fundamental forces — gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak — were unified into a single interaction, often called the force of quantum gravity<d-footnote>The unification of all four fundamental forces is a hypothetical state described by various approaches to quantum gravity, including string theory and loop quantum gravity.</d-footnote>. At the end of this epoch, the grand unified force (the combination of electroweak and strong nuclear forces) separated from gravity — marking the <strong>first symmetry breaking</strong> in the history of the universe.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-grand-unification-epoch-10-43--textseconds-rightarrow-10-35--textseconds">The Grand Unification Epoch ($10^{-43} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-35} \, \text{seconds}$)</h2> <p>Beginning from $10^{-43}$ seconds, the <strong>Grand Unification Epoch</strong> lasted until about $10^{-35}$ seconds. It is the first known era for which we have <em>somewhat</em> applicable physical theories. Many crucial events occurred during this epoch. It triggered the phenomenon of <strong>cosmic inflation</strong>, proposed by <em>Alan Guth</em> in the early 1980s (<d-cite key="guth1981inflation"></d-cite>). During this period, the electroweak force separated from the <strong>strong nuclear force</strong>, marking the start of the Electroweak Era, which continued until approximately $10^{-12}$ seconds. Inflation is regarded as an exponential expansion of space that lasted from about $10^{-36}$ seconds to $10^{-32}$ seconds. This rapid expansion distributed the newly formed elementary particles evenly throughout the universe and cooled its overall temperature.</p> <p>As inflation ended, an enormous amount of energy was released, reheating the universe and transforming it into a hot quark–gluon plasma — a process known as <strong>reheating</strong>, which lasted up to about $10^{-12}$ seconds. By roughly $10^{-11}$ seconds, all four fundamental forces had acquired their distinct identities, each becoming a separate ruling interaction of nature. With this milestone, the Very Early Universe Era came to an end.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-quark-epoch-10-12--textseconds-rightarrow-10-6--textseconds">The Quark Epoch ($10^{-12} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-6} \, \text{seconds}$)</h2> <p>The Early Universe Era began with the <strong>Quark Epoch</strong>, which lasted up to about $10^{-6}$ seconds. Although all four fundamental forces had by then separated, the universe remained extremely hot and dense — filled with a quark–gluon plasma. Within this fiery soup, quarks began to bind together through gluons, forming composite particles known as hadrons. Around this time, the electromagnetic force decoupled from the weak nuclear force, allowing them to act independently. Another pivotal event occurred during this epoch: <strong>baryogenesis</strong> — a process responsible for creating an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe.</p> <p>This epoch marks the <strong>first instance where matter began to dominate antimatter</strong>. Although most matter and antimatter particles annihilated upon collision, a tiny excess of matter — roughly one extra particle in every billion pairs — survived<d-footnote>This minute imbalance between matter and antimatter is the reason any matter exists in the present universe.</d-footnote>. The cause of this asymmetry remains one of the <strong>greatest unsolved mysteries in cosmology</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-hadron-epoch-10-6--textseconds-rightarrow-10-4--textseconds">The Hadron Epoch ($10^{-6} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-4} \, \text{seconds}$)</h2> <p>Despite the effects of <strong>baryogenesis</strong>, the extremely high temperature of the early universe made it possible for hadrons to annihilate once again into free quarks, reducing the overall matter number density. However, the next — and very brief — epoch, known as the <strong>Hadron Epoch</strong>, firmly established the dominance of matter over antimatter. During this epoch, the universe witnessed the formation of what is often described as a <strong>“protonic soup.”</strong> Since the proton is the least massive hadron, this phase concluded when the temperature of the universe dropped below its threshold temperature of approximately $10^{13}$ kelvin<d-footnote>At temperatures higher than $10^{13}$ K, protons and neutrons could not remain bound and would dissociate into free quarks and gluons.</d-footnote>. By the end of this epoch, the universe was filled with free baryons, consisting mainly of protons, neutrons, photons, and a few other subatomic particles — setting the stage for the Lepton Epoch that followed.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-lepton-epoch-10-4--textseconds-rightarrow-10--textseconds">The Lepton Epoch ($10^{-4} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10 \, \text{seconds}$)</h2> <p>The Hadron Epoch was followed by the <strong>Lepton Epoch</strong>, which spanned from approximately $10^{-4}$ seconds to about $10$ seconds after the Big Bang. This epoch consisted of two significant phases: <em>neutrino decoupling</em> and <em>leptogenesis</em>.</p> <p>During the <strong>neutrino decoupling</strong> phase, neutrinos began to separate from matter when the universe was roughly one second old and had a temperature of about ten billion kelvin ($10^{10}$ K). In this period, neutrinos stopped interacting with baryonic matter and no longer influenced the universe’s overall dynamics. Before decoupling, neutrinos and antineutrinos were in thermal equilibrium, maintained through processes of annihilation and scattering. However, as the universe expanded, the interaction rate of neutrinos via the weak force fell below the cosmic expansion rate, leading to their decoupling.</p> <p>Some scientists have suggested that, as a result of this decoupling, there must exist <em>relic neutrinos</em>, analogous to the cosmic microwave background radiations<d-footnote>Cosmic microwave background radiations (CMB) are the relic electromagnetic radiation from the time of recombination, serving as a snapshot of the universe when it was about 380,000 years old.</d-footnote>, permeating throughout the universe. If these cosmic background neutrinos truly exist, they would provide an extraordinary observational probe to study such an early phase of the universe and reveal its initial conditions<d-footnote>If future observations confirm their existence, these relic neutrinos would serve as a unique window into the earliest seconds of cosmic evolution.</d-footnote>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="leptogenesis-t-sim-1--textsecond-rightarrow-14--textseconds">Leptogenesis ($t \sim 1 \, \text{second} \rightarrow 14 \, \text{seconds}$)</h2> <p>Immediately after the neutrino decoupling, the universe entered the phase of <strong>leptogenesis</strong>. During this period, heavier leptons such as tau and muon particles were produced, but as the temperature continued to decrease, most of these heavy leptons annihilated or decayed into their lighter counterpart — the electron. Similar to baryogenesis, leptogenesis culminated in the dominance of leptons over antileptons. At this stage, the universe resembled a <strong>particle soup</strong> composed of electrons, positrons, protons, neutrinos, neutrons, and photons.</p> <p>An important outcome of this era was the <strong>nearly equalized proton–neutron ratio</strong>. Initially, a high neutrino interaction rate with neutrons caused many to convert into protons. However, as the universe cooled, this conversion slowed, and the ratio began to decrease<d-footnote>As the universe expanded and cooled, weak interactions that converted neutrons to protons froze out, leaving a residual neutron-to-proton ratio of roughly 1:6.</d-footnote>. Once the temperature dropped below the electron threshold temperature ($\sim 10^{10}$ K), neutrinos ceased to interact with electrons and other particles, reaching a state of thermal equilibrium. This epoch ended when the universe was around <strong>fourteen seconds old</strong>, leading into the <strong>Photon Epoch</strong>.<br/> Before diving into that, however, we will next discuss another pivotal chapter in cosmic evolution — <strong>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</strong>, which forged the first atomic nuclei in the young universe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="cosmology"/><category term="big-bang"/><category term="early-universe"/><category term="inflation"/><category term="baryogenesis"/><category term="neutrinos"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the Planck era to the lepton epoch — how our universe evolved in its first ten seconds.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Causal Metric Hypothesis–I</title><link href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/causal-metric-hypothesis-I/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Causal Metric Hypothesis–I"/><published>2021-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/causal-metric-hypothesis-I</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/causal-metric-hypothesis-I/"><![CDATA[<p>📄 A printable version of this article is available <a href="https://github.com/mbilalazam/mbilalazam.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/posts/2021-04-12-causal-metric-hypothesis-I/3_Causal_Metric_Hypothesis_CST_Blog.pdf">Causal Metric Hypothesis–I (PDF)</a></p> <hr/> <h2 id="general-version-of-hypothesis">General Version of Hypothesis</h2> <h3 id="background">Background</h3> <p>It can be safely stated the whole idea of the discrete causal theories relies on the question: “How to and up to which level, one can recover the continuum from the discrete spacetime?” Answer circles around a very important concept of metric recovery theorems. To refer to these theorems in a more broad sense, we will stick to the term, <em>causal metric hypothesis</em>, adopted by Dribus <d-cite key="Dribus2017"></d-cite>. In general, it can be stated as follows.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The properties of the physical universe are manifestations of causal structure.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This hypothesis relies upon the metric recovery theorems proposed and proven by Hawking <d-cite key="Hawking1975a"></d-cite> and Malament <d-cite key="Malament1976"></d-cite> in the late 1970s. However, it received a remarkable share in the research community when Rafael Sorkin proposed this as an explicit structural ansatz for the causal set theory <d-cite key="Sorkin2009"></d-cite>. He states:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Order plus number equals geometry.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This gives an entirely new meaning to the scope of metric recovery theorems and proposes the <em>discrete and directed structure</em> for spacetime at the most fundamental (or quantum) levels. The causal set idea, one of the most prominent proponents of discrete spacetime, is based upon Sorkin’s version of the causal metric hypothesis.</p> <p>Although the causal metric hypothesis is studied in the context of discrete spacetime, yet it does not require a strict assumption of discreteness. Causal metric hypothesis is needed to recover the geometry from the underlying spacetime, and in case of continuum spacetime, at least under the relativistic assumption, metric recovery theorems will not be quite sufficient and contains enough information to recover the geometry. However, there are versions of the causal metric hypothesis, which are neither discrete nor continuous. It is important to note, in causal set theory, Sorkin’s version is applied at the classical level<d-footnote>There is no fully-developed quantum causal set dynamics yet.</d-footnote> but is explicitly discrete. Such a discrete notion of spacetime invokes <em>counting</em>; count atoms, count volume, count everything, and it requires the condition of local finiteness.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="roots-of-the-causal-metric-hypothesis-and-emergent-spacetime">Roots of the Causal Metric Hypothesis and Emergent Spacetime</h3> <p>There is a whole lot of debates on the idea of causal metric hypothesis, from its philosophical aspects to its connection to modern exploration to nature. Roots of this hypothesis can be traced back to the ancient Greeks; a famous example would be Zeno’s paradox. In the modern era of science, from Leibniz to Riemann, Einstein to Finkelstein, and Hawking to Sorkin, everyone contributed. Despite all the popular and ambitious fantasy of philosophical and scientific aspects of the hypothesis and the technical results, it is still concerned whether this hypothesis is “true” or “almost true”? This hypothesis is such a great deal in itself that metric recovery theorems suggest that, at the very least, this should have been “almost true” in nature and the aspects of the geometrical structure of spacetime, which prevents the hypothesis from being exactly “true” does not actually exist but only in case of emergent spacetime. Moreover, as the concept of directed sets relies upon causality, so we may extend the scope of this causal structure even beyond the spacetime fabric, and it can include all sorts of physical interactions being observed in nature. It links the hypothesis to the modern attempts of unification.</p> <p>Before proceeding further, let us briefly discuss the ideas of <em>emergence</em> and <em>emergent spacetime</em>. In <em>reductionist philosophy</em>, one breaks down the “true” laws of nature into the most fundamental form. However, it remains a challenging task, how to construct and explain the exact (or even approximate) descriptions of macroscopic objects from these microscopic ideas. For example, in high school, we develop a structural model and dissect the frog to understand the individual parts, and it works well there. Nevertheless, still, there are complicated biological processes that cannot be understood with the same model. If one tries to explain, it is nearly impossible to get some adequate results to understand <em>all</em> the processes. Even in physics, any macroscopic system can be viewed as a verily large collection (ensemble) of microscopic states. Here, emergence describes those properties of the system, which occurs at the macroscopic scale but not on the microscopic level. For example, quantum properties are more fundamental than their classical counterparts, but the quantum structure cannot be observed at a macroscopic level. So, classical mechanics can be thought of as an emergent description of quantum mechanics under some limitations. Similarly, in condensed-matter systems, a large ensemble of fermions on the surface of metal forms a Fermi surface. It ultimately leads to the idea of Fermi liquid theory, which is an emergent phenomenon and does not require us to construct the individual excitation of fermions in a quantum field to model their behavior. However, it must be noted, in a philosophical sense, emergence may or may not contrast to the reductionist approach.</p> <p>On the same grounds, many phenomena and observational measurements compel to think that spacetime is not fundamental but is an effective description of nature, and there is some more fundamental theory whose degrees of freedom are quantum mechanical in nature. The dynamics of such a system emerge out the particles and fields living in a spacetime. Here comes an important point. The standard model of particle physics requires a fixed background spacetime to define causality and locality. All the interactions of particles appear on this fixed spacetime, and the features of causality and locality have been tested successfully millions of times in particle accelerators, and these accelerators work on TeV scales. It signifies, if such an emergent spacetime exists, it is much beyond the reach of present particle accelerators, that is, somewhere between the present TeV and Planck scale. Let us elaborate on the last point in the context of discrete causal theories. Einstein’s field equation is:</p> \[R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.\] <p>where $ R_{\mu\nu} $ is the Ricci curvature tensor, $ R $ is the Ricci scalar, $ g_{\mu\nu} $ is the metric tensor, $ \Lambda $ is the cosmological constant and $ T_{\mu\nu} $ is the stress-energy tensor. This equation applies to the classical spacetime, as depicted in the left-hand diagram in the figure below. Warped dark gray triangles represent the set of events that could be causally connected to event $ x $. Middle diagram is a magnified view of a region near to the event $ x $, and according to causal set theory, at such a small scale, discreteness or granularity of spacetime starts appearing, so Einstein’s field equations will start losing their precision. However, this is an intermediate scale, and it can still be approximated to the continuum spacetime. Despite the intermediate scales, these are still very much larger than the probing ability of present accelerators, raising some important issues to worry about:</p> <ol> <li>Up to which order, such an approximation can produce consistent and effective results?</li> <li>These deviations are quite noticeable, how they will manifest themselves experimentally?</li> </ol> <p>To handle these issues, people suggested the systematic violations of Lorentz invariance, but we will explore the technical details and reasoning behind its proposition in future blog posts. The right-hand diagram in the figure is a highly magnified version of spacetime region around the event $ x $ and represents the hypothesized granularity of spacetime. Discreteness is quite evident at this level, geometry is no more smooth, and Einstein’s field equation becomes essentially irrelevant. It should not be surprising that $ x $ could have been connected to a very large number of spacetime atoms (or satoms<d-footnote>This term is coined by Maqbool Ahmed.</d-footnote>) say $ 10^{50} $ or more. Black nodes are the events causally connected to $ x $, while light gray nodes are causally not related to $ x $.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-04-12-causal-metric-hypothesis-I/blog_cstheory_3_figure_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2021-04-12-causal-metric-hypothesis-I/blog_cstheory_3_figure_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2021-04-12-causal-metric-hypothesis-I/blog_cstheory_3_figure_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-04-12-causal-metric-hypothesis-I/blog_cstheory_3_figure_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Classical spacetime according to discrete causal theory (Benjamin Dribus 2017)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Classical spacetime according to discrete causal theory (<d-cite key="Dribus2017"></d-cite>). </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <h3 id="restatement-of-the-general-version-of-causal-metric-hypothesis">Restatement of the General Version of Causal Metric Hypothesis</h3> <p>In the start, we present the general statement, proposed by <d-cite key="Dribus2017"></d-cite>, as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The properties of the physical universe are manifestations of causal structure.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This statement takes the cause-and-effect relationship as a primary tenet to the physical phenomena and invokes that “physics is <em>essentially structured</em> in nature.” However, the scope of this tenet as a fundamental building block of nature is questionable in its extent. So, the hypothesis is interpreted differently in its comprehensiveness. For a conservationist, properties of <em>physical universe</em> are the mere descriptions of the <em>spacetime</em>. So we can redefine the above statement as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The properties of the spacetime are manifestations of causal structure.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Such a feature is possessed by theories that have a limited degree of background independence, such as the discrete quantum field theories and some theories of gravity too. This is somewhat a <em>weak interpretation</em> of the causal metric hypothesis. In a <em>strong interpretation</em> sense, one thinks of <em>all</em> the properties of the physical universe being emerged out from the deep underlying causal structure. It is stated as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“All the properties of the physical universe are manifestations of causal structure.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This statement is quite radical in itself and requires and enables a doorway to <em>perfect background independence</em>. At this point, it seems necessary to discuss background independence briefly. It always remains a subtle question of interest in theoretical physics, whether a theory of quantum gravity would be background dependent or independent. This condition asserts that background spacetime is not fixed; instead, this results from the dynamical equations. A background independent theory is said to be <em>coordinate-free</em> theory, as Einstein’s theory of general relativity is. In such a theory, the results can be inferred from the <em>first principles</em>. Newton’s law of gravitation is:</p> \[F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}.\] <p>Remaining in the Newtonian context, one always has to perform experiments to see a $ r $-squared term in the denominator. It is impossible to figure out from the first principles, what power $ r $ will take? So, we can say, the Newtonian theory is background dependent. However, in GR, one can get this $ r $-squared term comes from the first principles. It comes naturally. So, Einstein’s theory confirms that gravity is a background independent theory. Similarly, the action functional of the electromagnetic field $ S[A] $ is also background dependent, but when it is coupled to gravity, $ S[A,g] $ becomes background independent. The Maxwell and Einstein-Hilbert action functionals are given as <d-cite key="Blau2019"></d-cite>:</p> \[\begin{align*} S_\text{EM}[A] &amp;= -\frac{1}{4} \int F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g} d^4 x, \\ S_\text{EH}[g] &amp;= \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int_M R_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g} d^4 x. \end{align*}\] <p>Such a background independent treatment of a physical theory is the corollary of the principle of general covariance. Upon seeing the actions of both fields, one can get confused, but it is always important to keep in mind that “diffeomorphism invariance is not the same as background independence.” We will dedicate a blog in the future to elaborate this difference in detail, but let us turn our attention back to the causal metric hypothesis.</p> <p>Relativistic understanding and causal metric hypothesis are more or less way to look at the same thing. In Einstein’s relativity, one may prescribe which events may influence $ x $ or which events, $ x $ may influence (see the figure above). This is the “prescription of possible behavior.” On the other hand, the causal metric hypothesis gives an approximate<d-footnote>Here, the word “approximation” is of extreme importance. It is linked with the question we posed earlier, up to which conformal factor, the macroscopic world can be recovered from the underlying spacetime. Quantitatively, we will discuss this in future blog posts.</d-footnote> way to describe, in actual, which events influence $ x $ and which events are influenced by $ x $. This is the “description of actual behavior.” So, we can describe Wheeler’s famous statement <d-cite key="Wheeler2010Geons"></d-cite>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve,”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>in the context of discrete causal theories as <d-cite key="Dribus2017"></d-cite>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Things happen; ‘spacetime’ and ‘matter’ are ways of describing them.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This, somewhat, seems to have a philosophical connection. However, it is equally important in discrete causal theories as it directly relates to the concept of perfect background independence.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="technical-implementation-of-causal-metric-hypothesis">Technical Implementation of Causal Metric Hypothesis</h3> <p>The technical implementation of CMH has its own meaning in the classical and quantum world. It is a matter of a great deal, what is the mathematical definition of the causal structure? Or what is the meaning of causal structure mathematically? Or how to identify causal structure in mathematical terms? In the following posts, we will stick to the classical causal metric hypothesis (CCMH), which models classical spacetime via a directed set. To make theory capable of giving the quantitative description of nature, some conditions or the <em>axioms</em> are imposed on it, for instance, the partially ordered sets in causal set theory. Usually, these axioms are applied to the hypothesis based on the physical intuition, but experimental and observational results also play their role, whenever it seems adequately necessary. In the next episode on CMH, we will study the quantitative and qualitative treatment of the classical causal metric hypothesis.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="previous-blog-posts">Previous Blog Posts</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/">What do we need Quantum Gravity?</a></li> <li><a href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/a-picture-and-an-equation/">A Picture and an Equation</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="quantum-gravity"/><category term="causal-set-theory"/><category term="spacetime"/><category term="metric-recovery"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring the causal metric hypothesis, its philosophical roots, and its role in defining the discrete structure of spacetime within causal set theory.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Picture and an Equation</title><link href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/a-picture-and-an-equation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Picture and an Equation"/><published>2021-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/a-picture-and-an-equation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/a-picture-and-an-equation/"><![CDATA[<p>📄 A printable version of this article is available <a href="https://github.com/mbilalazam/mbilalazam.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/2_A_Picture_and_an_Equation_v1.pdf">A Picture and an Equation (PDF)</a></p> <hr/> <p>In the <a href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2021/why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/">previous blog post</a>, we aimed at the questions which compel us to start a pursuit for a quantum theory of gravity. From now on, we will begin paving the path for the discrete versions of spacetime. A famous adage says, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” and this is profoundly true in science. The relation between physics and figures is as old as the history of physics itself. A typical science student becomes familiar with figures (particularly <em>free-body diagrams</em>) while solving everyday mechanics problems via Newton’s laws. In the second half of the last century, Feynman elevated diagrams to a new level, using them to study complex quantum interactions and associating equations with different segments of those diagrams. In the next section, we briefly review some notable examples — from quantum field theory to relativity.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="an-equation-and-a-picture">An Equation and a Picture</h2> <p>The idea of modeling physical processes — or even equations — through <em>pictures</em> dates back to the iconoclastic Richard P. Feynman, who introduced his famous diagrams in 1949 <d-cite key="Feynman1949"></d-cite>. Feynman diagrams provide simple visualizations of abstract mathematical ideas. Imagine electrons represented by solid lines. Arrows pointing forward in time denote particles; those pointing backward represent antiparticles. When two such lines meet and exchange a photon (a wiggly line), the diagram captures the entire interaction. The first published Feynman diagram is shown below. Employing Feynman rules, one can assign mathematical formulas to each part of the diagram — and the computed results match those from the cumbersome mathematics of quantum fields.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-03-07-a-picture-and-an-equation/feynman_diagram_01.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Exchange of one photon between two electrons (Feynman 1949)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Exchange of one photon between two electrons (<d-cite key="Feynman1949"></d-cite>). </div> </div> </div> <p>Feynman diagrams have proved so useful that they have become integral to quantum field theory.

Lower-level structures — drawn as filled dots inside these open nodes — connect via lines to other nodes or remain isolated. This recalls the “ball-and-stick” molecular model. In physics, however, these structures are far simpler yet extremely powerful: they encode <em>classical universes</em> or <em>histories</em>. Both terms are used interchangeably in causal theories, though “histories” emphasizes an extended process rather than isolated snapshots of spacetime. At this stage, we are not yet concerned with what these histories model or their size. But since they form the most fundamental structural units of spacetime, they must represent local processes such as particle interactions — likely many orders of magnitude smaller than the particles themselves.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="representation-of-structures">Representation of Structures</h2> <p>The “ball-and-stick” (or “node-and-edge”) representation exists at both structural levels. However, the edges are <em>directed</em> — each connecting an initial and a terminal node. These nodes are <em>events</em>, and the directed edges represent <em>cause-and-effect</em> relations. This is where <strong>causality</strong> enters. Such sets of events (or objects) are called <em>directed sets</em><d-footnote>I will explain its technical details in upcoming posts.</d-footnote>. Before proceeding, we label the two structural levels as:</p> <ul> <li>Higher-level structures → <em>quantum structures</em></li> <li>Lower-level structures → <em>classical structures</em></li> </ul> <p>Many readers may find this labeling counterintuitive: classical physics usually describes <em>large-scale</em> behavior, while quantum theory deals with the <em>microscopic</em>. Yet, this labeling becomes natural when viewed through Feynman’s <em>path-integral</em> (or <em>sum-over-histories</em>) approach <d-cite key="Feynman2005"></d-cite>. Feynman’s 1948 formulation generalizes the classical action principle. In classical mechanics, a particle has a unique trajectory between two points. In Feynman’s framework, it may take <em>any</em> of infinitely many paths. Each possible path contributes a phase (or amplitude), and summing all phases yields the observable quantum amplitude. In Feynman’s own words <d-cite key="Herbert1987"></d-cite>:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The electron does anything it likes … It goes in any direction at any speed, forward and backward in time, however it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the wave function.”</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>Another reason to accept this “inverted” labeling is the <strong>supremacy of quantum theory</strong>: the classical world emerges from quantum principles. In our terminology, higher-level (quantum) structures generate lower-level (classical) ones. To clarify what “classical” means, let’s note:</p> <ul> <li>Technically, it refers to a <em>specific permissible physical scenario</em> — for example, a unique trajectory. In discrete causal theories, such scenarios are determined from the axioms rather than from equations of motion. Histories satisfying these axioms are <em>permissible</em> and treated equally; those that don’t are excluded.</li> <li>Conventionally, “classical” describes anything measurable at large scales and low energies. Bohr’s correspondence principle formalizes this: <blockquote> <p>“The predictions of classical and quantum mechanics agree in the limit of large quantum numbers.” <d-cite key="French1979"></d-cite></p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Hence, quantum and classical theories are equally fundamental but describe different structural levels. The quantum structure is <strong>more complete</strong>, encompassing all possible scenarios, while the classical structure isolates a single one.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="how-to-model-a-picture-with-an-equation">How to Model a Picture with an Equation?</h2> <p>The hierarchical structure we’ve discussed naturally defines a <strong>structured configuration space</strong> — a <em>kinematic scheme</em> encoded by sequential evolutionary processes. A configuration space represents all possible states of a system.</p> <p>For example, in classical mechanics, a particle’s position is given by coordinates $(x, y, z)$. To describe motion, we use two sets of coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, forming a function $\psi(x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2)$ which lives in a six-dimensional configuration space.</p> <p>By generalizing this concept through a <em>path-summation</em> approach, any quantum object can be represented in such a space. To “model a picture with an equation,” we sum contributions from all possible paths in this configuration space — after translating structural points into appropriate mathematical objects. This process yields quantum amplitudes and observables, forming a predictive framework that emerges naturally from the underlying causal structure of events. The resulting algebraic framework produces the <strong>dynamical laws</strong> of the theory.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="causal-schrödinger-type-equations">Causal Schrödinger-Type Equations</h3> <p>In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathrm{i}\hbar \frac{d\psi}{dt} = \hat{H}\psi. \end{align*}\] <p>Here $\psi$ is the state function (an element of Hilbert space) and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.</p> <p>Analogously, the <strong>causal Schrödinger-type equation</strong> <d-cite key="Dribus2017"></d-cite> is:</p> \[\begin{align*} \psi^{-}_{R;\theta} = \theta(r) \sum_{r^{-} \prec r} \psi^{-}_{R;\theta}(r^{-}). \end{align*}\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>$\psi^{-}_{R;\theta}$ — generalized past-state function</li> <li>$\theta(r)$ — relation function (analogous to the Lagrangian)</li> <li>$R$ — a subobject in configuration space containing <em>co-relative histories</em> for elements $r$ and $r^{-}$</li> <li>$r^{-} \prec r$ — denotes that $r^{-}$ precedes $r$ (encodes <strong>causality</strong>)</li> </ul> <p>This equation can also be viewed as a <strong>discrete heat equation</strong>, for reasons analogous to the Schrödinger equation in conventional quantum theory.

Quantum (field) theory successfully accommodates all the interactions of nature in its framework but gravity. This framework is called the <strong>Standard Model of Particle Physics</strong>. However, general relativity is the only available tool to study all the manifestations of the gravitational field. Despite all the efforts, we are unable to wed general relativity to quantum theory.

To answer this, let us visit the first two questions in the next section.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="motivations-for-quantum-gravity">Motivations for Quantum Gravity</h3> <p>Before proceeding, it would be essential to note that certain <em>uniqueness theorems</em> say whatever theory of quantum gravity we develop must approximate Einstein’s GR (or Einstein–Cartan theory<d-footnote>Einstein–Cartan theory is the natural generalization of GR. It is written in the language of tensors and spinors to accommodate fermions and quarks in gravity. (We might discuss it in detail at some later point.)</d-footnote>) in some limit.</p> <p>General relativity is a remarkably successful theory in its realm. Still, there are some rudimentary observational pieces of evidence that point out discrepancies in theoretical models and suggest a more fundamental viewpoint about gravity. Some of the primary motivations for quantum gravity are:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Unification:</strong><br/> Physicists are reductionists. The history of science shows that reductionism has been proven very successful. The Standard Model is one of its prime examples where all the non-gravitational interactions can be studied under a single gauge group, $\mathrm{SU(3)} \times \mathrm{SU(2)} \times \mathrm{U(1)}.$ In the last century, we have seen the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces (electroweak). Why would there be a reason gravity cannot be unified with others? It should be.</p> <p>Interestingly, there are also attempts to construct semiclassical frameworks in which all other forces are quantum while gravity remains essentially classical. However, all of these efforts have failed miserably. It indicates that classical and quantum concepts are likely incompatible, as inferred in the early days of quantum mechanics.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Universe:</strong><br/> All the attempts of gravity quantization face one severe problem — they are not UV complete. They break at high-energy scales. From the evolution history of the universe<d-footnote><a href="https://mbilalazam.com/1-evolution-history-of-universe-a-story-from-zero-to-ten-seconds/" target="_blank">Evolution History of the Universe — A Story from Zero to Ten Seconds</a></d-footnote>, it is known that the present classical infrastructure of gravity tells us nothing about the initial conditions near the Big Bang or what happens at the sub-Planckian scale and final stages of black hole evolution. I want to discuss one example from cosmology and one from black holes in some detail.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Cosmology:</strong><br/> There are cosmological solutions, in agreement with observations, that successfully predict an accelerated expansion of the universe<d-footnote>We will discuss this problem in detail in the phenomenology of causal set theory.</d-footnote>. From this result, it can be extrapolated that this expansion started, at some zero cosmic time, from a highly dense point (or singularity) with no spatial dimensions. It is where classical GR fails to yield any feasible result(s). This inability to extract any information from this singularity and the subsequent Planck era signifies the need for a theory of quantized gravity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Holes:</strong><br/> Annoyingly mysterious black holes also qualify as a testable region for quantum gravity. In the early seventies, Bekenstein interpreted the entropy of a black hole in terms of the area of its event horizon <d-cite key="Bekenstein1973"></d-cite>, and Hawking conjectured that black holes emit thermal radiation having a black-body spectrum <d-cite key="Hawking1975"></d-cite>. This brings about an identicalness in the thermal behavior of black holes and the conventional laws of thermodynamics. Classical GR fails to explain it well because entropy is described under the notion of discrete states of a quantum system in traditional thermodynamics. It makes black hole entropy phenomenologically important in the search for quantized gravity.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Time:</strong><br/> It is one of the most radical issues in the pursuit of QG. Quantum and generally covariant theories (like GR) have drastically different concepts of time — they are incompatible. In quantum theory, time is available as an external parameter. It is not described by an operator; it is kinematical, absolute, and universal. Even in relativistic QFT, external Minkowski spacetime plays the role of absolute time. While in GR, time is a dynamical object. It is relative and non-absolute. It is not available as an external parameter; it needs to be constructed <em>naturally</em> by the theory itself. It is quite clear that the definition of time must be modified to develop a fully fledged theory of quantum gravity. We will revisit the problem of time while discussing the role of background structures in quantum gravity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Divergence:</strong><br/> Gravity is non-renormalizable. It breaks at high-energy scales and yields infinities. It is still an open issue how to cure these divergences. There should be no divergences for any quantum version of gravity, as there are none in quantum field theory.</p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="cut-off-scales-of-quantum-gravity">Cut-Off Scales of Quantum Gravity</h2> <p>Length, mass, and time are fundamental — the most basic physical quantities — and the speed of light $(c)$, gravitational constant $(G)$, and quantum of action $(\hbar)$ are the fundamental constants of nature. Can we form these quantities from the constants of general relativity, $c$ and $G$, or the constants of quantum theory, $c$ and $\hbar$? <strong>No!</strong> There is no possible combination of these two sets of universal constants that can produce any of the fundamental quantities.</p> <p>But can we derive these quantities using <em>all</em> of these constants in any combination? <strong>Yes.</strong> In honor of Max Planck, these units are called <em>Planck units</em><d-footnote>For the sake of completeness — Planck units are defined exclusively in terms of four universal constants. The fourth one is the Boltzmann constant, $k_\text{B}$. Using the four constants, one can also define Planck units of temperature, density, the fine-structure constant of gravity, and charge.</d-footnote>. These units are:</p> \[\begin{align*} \text{Planck length} &amp;= l_\text{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.62\times10^{-33}\ \text{cm}, \\ \text{Planck time} &amp;= t_\text{P} = \frac{l_\text{P}}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.39\times10^{-44}\ \text{s}, \\ \text{Planck mass} &amp;= m_\text{P} = \frac{\hbar}{l_\text{P} c} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.18\times10^{-5}\ \text{g}. \end{align*}\] <p>One may be bewildered by noticing that Planck mass is horrendously a larger quantity than Planck length and Planck time. But it is worth noting that $m_\text{P}$ must be concentrated in a linear dimension $l_\text{P}$; otherwise, we will not be able to observe quantum effects of gravity. At this scale, classical properties become an emergent phenomenon of quantum theory. These scales provide the cut-offs to observe quantum gravity.</p> <p>We can easily realize that these scales are nearly impossible to detect and observe with the present technology. However, these scales do not provide stringent limits on gravity — these are just the most natural possible cut-offs. The unified theory of forces may also contain other parameters; for instance, in string theory, the fundamental length scale is the string length $l_\text{S}$ rather than the Planck length $l_\text{P}$. Nevertheless, it is an educated guess to set $l_\text{S} = l_\text{P}$.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="approaches-to-quantum-gravity">Approaches to Quantum Gravity</h2> <p>Since the 1930s, there has been no shortage of proposed theories for the quantization of gravitational fields<d-footnote>A list of candidate theories can be found on the following Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#Candidate_theories" target="_blank">Quantum Gravity — Candidate Theories</a>. However, this is not an exhaustive list.</d-footnote>. No idea is complete; no theory is entirely consistent with quantum fields. No theory provides a way to put it to experimental tests; every approach suffers from conceptual problems. Every theory meets observational discrepancies.</p> <p>Issues are there, but even today, the charm of quantum gravity has not faded away — nothing is more fascinating than the problems of gravity. It is challenging to review all the approaches to quantum gravity in just one section; however, I will try to briefly discuss its main research directions. The subsequent sections may contain some <em>fancy</em> technical terms which I will intentionally try to oversimplify, and it may cause the text to lose some of its essence (so advanced readers are advised to see <d-cite key="Oriti2009"></d-cite> and <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite> and references therein, upon which this section is based).</p> <h3 id="three-and-half-directions">Three-and-Half Directions</h3> <p>Research in quantum gravity can be mapped onto three main — and some <em>neglected</em> — lines:</p> <ul> <li>covariant</li> <li>canonical</li> <li>sum-over-histories</li> <li>others</li> </ul> <p>This list does not qualify to be a precise way to describe research directions since these names are somewhat misleading and sometimes are used interchangeably. Still, they possess specific scientific rationality, developmental logic, and methodological unity. Often, one approach becomes a hot topic, and others get neglected — this has happened repeatedly over the years. However, all of these approaches share some common features, and many ideas cannot fit neatly into any one of these directions.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covariant Approach:</strong><br/> Started in the early thirties by Rosenfeld, Fierz, and Pauli, it is one of the most dominant research directions in the pursuit of quantum gravity. It is an attempt to construct a quantum field theory of gravity. In covariant approaches, fluctuations of the metric element are studied over a four-dimensional Lorentzian flat spacetime or some other appropriate background metric. Rules and equations were established in the sixties by Feynman, Faddeev, and others, while the approach was proved to be non-renormalizable by ’t Hooft and others in the seventies. The search for renormalizability gave birth to string theory in the late eighties — whose sun has not set to date.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Canonical Approach:</strong><br/> Initiated by Dirac and pioneered by Wheeler, DeWitt, and Ashtekar, it is the Hamiltonian (or canonical) formulation of general relativity. In this approach, phase-space variables are promoted to quantum operators on a Hilbert space, and these operators correspond to the full metric or some of its functions. The canonical approach started gaining attention when the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG) was established. LQG remains one of the most significant competitors to string theory.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sum-Over-Histories Approach:</strong><br/> Feynman pioneered the path-integral (SOH) formulation, which proved itself as one of the most successful formalisms of quantum theory. In the quantum world, there are infinite ways (paths) to go from some initial point to a final point, and the probabilities are given by adding contributions from all the possible trajectories (or histories). Similarly, in gravity, this sum is taken over all possible geometries of spacetime. Some discrete causal approaches to quantum gravity are based on different versions of SOH — for instance, the spinfoam formalism or the causal set approach.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Other Approaches:</strong><br/> These include effective field theories (such as non-commutative geometry), Penrose’s twistor theory, Regge calculus, causal dynamical triangulation, causal sets, and many more. Some of the alternate approaches have suffered from serious and fundamental crises, while others are too mathematical to describe physical reality. Still, many of these ideas provide astonishing insight into the phenomenology of quantum gravity and bridge the gap between theoretical and observational discrepancies.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is also important to note that only string theory claims to be the unified version of all fundamental forces — or, loosely speaking, the <em>theory of everything</em> — while all other approaches provide different ways to merge quantum theory with general relativity. None of these approaches have matured into fully fledged quantum versions of gravity. All ideas are still in development. Some proposed versions of gravitational theories have an established kinematical side but lack a dynamical framework. For avid history readers, the evolution of research in quantum gravity is summed up in Figure below, taken from <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Lastly, we have briefly reviewed the idea of quantum gravity, its need, present problems, and some of the possible directions. Readers may visit the references (and references therein) for a detailed outlook of the topic. This series is dedicated to <em>causal set theory</em>, initiated by Rafael Sorkin in the early eighties, and from the next post, we will try to discuss it from the very basics. We will discuss the need for discrete causal approaches and the causal metric hypothesis, which will lead us to one of the most important theoretical breakthroughs of the last century — <em>metric recovery theorems</em>.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/history_of_qg_rovelli.svg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-31-why-do-we-need-quantum-gravity/history_of_qg_rovelli.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The search for a quantum theory of the gravitational field (adapted from Rovelli 2004)." loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The search for a quantum theory of the gravitational field (adapted from <d-cite key="Rovelli2004"></d-cite>). </div> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="quantum-gravity"/><category term="causal-set-theory"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation behind quantum gravity and causal sets.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan</title><link href="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan"/><published>2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mbilalazam.github.io/blog/2019/Riazuddin/"><![CDATA[<p>📄 A printable version of this article is available <a href="https://github.com/mbilalazam/mbilalazam.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/dr_riazuddin.pdf">Riazuddin: The Self-Effacing Quintessential Physicist of Pakistan (PDF)</a></p> <blockquote> <p><em>A tribute to one of Pakistan’s greatest theoretical physicists,<br/> whose quiet brilliance helped shape the nation’s scientific destiny.</em></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>It was tumultuous 1947 when the world observed the violent partition of India. Bloodthirsty savages put up communal riots all over the country. Religiously divided Ludhiana was also engulfed. Meanwhile, a lower middle-class family left the city for good and migrated to the newly established Pakistan. There were 17 years old twins in the family, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin, who schooled in Islamia High School ran by Anjuman-i-Islamia philanthropy. Their inquisitiveness and appetite for knowledge were out of bounds. It was an ultimate sign of their dedication towards the beloved homeland that after losing all material possession in migration, they didn’t bemoan but ready to construe dreams with the hope of bright future. So the family enrolled the children in Government Muhammadan Oriental (MAO) College but soon got admission in Government College Lahore (now Government College University, Lahore) in 1949.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Professor Riazuddin — Early Years" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Professor Riazuddin (1930–2013), one of Pakistan’s most distinguished theoretical physicists.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/phys/khodja/Riazuddin.htm" target="_blank">King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>In Government College Lahore, they started studying engineering but they couldn’t make their way spectacular and stunning. So a teacher there suggested them to study physics rather than engineering. Riazuddin gave his assent. Although it was quite disturbing and uninteresting situation for Riazuddin yet it was the outset of a celebrated career in the cosmos of physics. It was Government College Lahore, where Riazuddin met with his mentor Abdus Salam, in 1951. Salam’s sharp-witted personality and perspicacity to deal with theories in physics made him the rising star in the physics community all over the world. It was not only Riazuddin but the nations who spurred by Salam. After declining the offer of professorship at Cambridge, Salam joined Government College, Lahore and at the same time, he started a new course of Quantum Mechanics in Punjab University, Lahore. It was Salam’s repute who drew the attention of students. But only Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin got success in surviving the thicket of mathematical equations involved in quantum mechanics. Although it was a disheartened experience for Salam yet the twins made their identification as best students in that course.</p> <hr/> <p>Riazuddin got his Master’s degree in mathematics from Government College Lahore under the mentorship of Abdus Salam and joined his alma mater in 1954 as a lecturer in mathematics. Riazuddin left for Cambridge in 1955 on the invitation of Dr. Abdus Salam to pursue his doctorate under his supervision. His dissertation entitled <em>“Charge Radius of Pion”</em> got published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on May 15, 1959. It dealt with certain regularities underlying nuclear forces. It was an influential research paper but something more outstanding was yet to come.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Riazuddin with Abdus Salam at ICTP, Trieste" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Professor Riazuddin (left) with his mentor, Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam, at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://www.ictp.it/news/2013/9/memoriam" target="_blank">ICTP — In Memoriam (2013)</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>After his return to Pakistan in 1959, he joined Punjab University Lahore as an associate professor of mathematics. In 1963, Norman March and Michael Duff awarded him a fellowship in the United States and he became a research associate professor at University of Rochester. He stayed there until 1965. His stay extended there and in 1965, he joined the University of Pennsylvania to teach physics until 1966. Meantime, his brother Fayyazuddin also completed his doctorate on <em>“Preliminary Analysis of Photoproduction of K Mesons in the Mandelstam Representation.”</em> On his way to University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi Institute, Riazuddin convened his brother along with Faheem Hussain (late) <d-footnote>Faheem Hussain was recently awarded *Spirit of Abdus Salam Award (2016)* along with Seifallah Randjbar-Daemi and Galileo Violini by *The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)* Trieste, Italy.</d-footnote> in Illinois. In 1966, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin published an authoritative research paper entitled <em>“Algebra of Current Components and Decay Widths of ρ and K* Mesons”</em> in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on July 29, 1966. It is the widely used Kawarabayashi–Suzuki–Riazuddin–Fayyazuddin (KSRF) relation. Actually, this fruitful relation was separately derived by Japanese scientists Ken Kawarabayashi and Mahiko Suzuki and Pakistani twin scientists Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin. According to Pervez Hoodbhoy, <em>“The Relation (KSRF) has stood the test of experiment, but even today continues to tantalize physicists — because it works so much better than it really should.”</em></p> <hr/> <p>Riazuddin found 1968, an efficacious year, for him. He came back to Pakistan on the request of Abdus Salam and joined Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad’s Institute of Physics (now National Centre for Physics). Vibrant research groups on relativity, particle physics, and string theory were brought about in those days. On Salam’s postulation, Enrico Fermi Institute had also engaged its scientists in such groups. It was the start of an entirely new epoch in the field of physics in Pakistan. But still there is one more thing was to come into being on the part of Riazuddin in 1969, which made him acknowledged all over the world. It was his classical and well-founded textbook in particle physics <em>Theory of Weak Interactions in Particle Physics</em> coauthored with C. P. Ryan and Robert E. Marshak. He also penned two widely recognized textbooks, together with Fayyazuddin, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> in 1990 and <em>A Modern Introduction to Particle Physics</em> in 1992.</p> <hr/> <p>Salam’s relation with Riazuddin was lenient and unparalleled. Two nonpareil physicists of the homeland enthralled the physicists of all castes and creeds all over the world. International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Trieste, Italy shortly after its establishment became world’s leading cornerstone research institute. Riazuddin, along with Salam’s other students, created theoretical physics group there.</p> <p>Astonishingly, it was ICTP, where Salam summoned Riazuddin and advised him to meet Munir Ahmed Khan upon his return to Pakistan to start the progress for the designing of the atomic bomb. In Salam’s views, the creation of theoretical physics group in Pakistan was mandatary to explore the technical aspects of fissile core and triggering mechanics of fissile material. Riazuddin made himself busy in the collection and analysis of data, which he procured from research papers, Manhattan project, Los Alamos laboratory etc. and started working day and night with sagacious engineers and canny physicists. Now, the rest was history. By shrugging off conspiracies, Pakistan made its way towards success. There was mass jubilation on May 28, 1998.</p> <hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-10-05-Riazuddin/riazuddin_salam_fiazuddin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and Pervez Hoodbhoy at Quaid-i-Azam University, 2012" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and Pervez Hoodbhoy relaxing at the tea huts, Quaid-i-Azam University, 2012.<br/> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: gray;">Image source: <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/778147-a-physicists-journey" target="_blank">The News International — “A Physicist’s Journey”</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>Overlooking minute details, in my opinion, the nation has forgotten the man who adept at complex calculations involved in the set-up of a nuclear arsenal. Riazuddin played a seminal and catalytic role, on the advice of Abdus Salam, in Pakistan’s nuclear program. He awarded with <em>Hilal-i-Imtiaz</em> by the Government of Pakistan but it can never be the meed of Riazuddin’s diligence.</p> <p>Once Riazuddin dreamt that he would transform and develop National Centre for Physics on the lines of ICTP. He became the director of NCP but unluckily owing to administrative and political reasons, he could not have expounded his dream and removed by authorities from the directorship of NCP.</p> <p>Riazuddin remained in search of something new. He wanted to find modern ways to look at. Being a dignified professor, it was his commitment and passion which made him the great Riazuddin. He knew how to evolve in the essence of theoretical physics. Around 165 research papers in reputed journals all over the world, more than 1900 citations along with a number of books, Riazuddin became one of the ever-leading physicists of the country.</p> <hr/> <p>One can easily recognize his thirst for knowledge by the fact that this self-effacing quintessential physicist published his last paper on August 20, 2013 at the age of 82 just 29 days before his demise. On September 9, 2013, this archetypal scientist took his last breath but had left an unexampled legacy. Motherland produced only a handful of physicists like Riazuddin who have exceptional advocacy and subservient innovation. He left this materialistic world but his affection and services will remain forever with us.<br/> Riazuddin made us proud. We cannot pay his debt for the services he offered for us. But we can tribute to his intentness by following his footsteps with great zeal, glorious knack, coherent allegiance, and continuous hard work.</p> <p>He often said that <em>“It was the idealism of the youth which not only enabled many of us, who could have stayed abroad, to return, but also infused a great enthusiasm to succeed in the pioneering role of establishing a new institution from scratch.”</em><br/> He tried to encourage his students, talented youth of motherland, with sententious comments:<br/> <em>“One has to live this life only once in this world. So try to do something of which you would proud of. Learn and spread knowledge and try to create new knowledge. Be helpful to others.”</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Muhammad Bilal Azam</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="Pakistan"/><category term="history"/><category term="Abdus"/><category term="Salam"/><category term="Riazuddin"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tribute article on Professor Riazuddin — one of Pakistan’s greatest theoretical physicists and a close collaborator of Abdus Salam.]]></summary></entry></feed>
